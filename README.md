# TACO
this project has the purpose of creating a new programming language to be used in Mexico and other spanish speaking countries in order to simplify and streamline computer science learning

The folder labeled 'lang' contains the code for the actual language, which will compile to javascript as to make it possible for the IDE to run it without requiring a server, therefore making it offline.

the files in the main directory are those that contain the actual IDE, for now a Code Editor.
The editor is based on ACE. For more information see: https://ace.c9.io/

You can find the current code editor in the following link https://rafaelriosgarcia.github.io/TACO/
