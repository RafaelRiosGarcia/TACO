# TACO STRUCTURE

the purpose of taco is to make it easier for kids or adults from spanish speaking countries to learn programming, therefore the structure of the language and obviously the word will be in spanish. It will follow and closely mimic P5.js in it's structure, therefore allowing it to be used as an independent library at some point, so even at a high level Spanish speaking programmers will be able to use it, not being limited to this IDE.

The language will simply be a redefinition of the whole js language made in spanish as a starter, and will later be turned into an ACE package so that autocomplete and other functions will work inside of it.
