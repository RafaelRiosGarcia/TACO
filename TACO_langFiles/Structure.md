# TACO STRUCTURE

the purpose of taco is to make it easier for kids or adults from spanish speaking countries to learn programming, therefore the structure of the language and obviously the word will be in spanish. It will follow and closely mimic P5.js in it's structure, therefore allowing it to be used as an independent library at some point, so even at a high level Spanish speaking programmers will be able to use it, not being limited to this IDE.
